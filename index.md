## Welcome!
{% include image.html url="images/anagha.jpg" caption="" max_width="3px" align="right" %}

I am a PhD student majoring in Computer Science at [Arizona State University]. I am a member of [Yochan] research group directed by [Prof. Subbarao Kambhampati]. Broadly, my interests lie in the field of Human-Aware AI, Privacy Preservation for AI Agents and Explainable AI Planning. 

Before joining ASU in 2015, I did my Master's at [University of Southern California] with a major in Computer Science. At USC, I worked on multi-agent path planning problems at [IDM Lab] while being supervised by [Dr. T. K. Satish Kumar] and on human-robot interaction related projects at [Interaction Lab] while being mentored by [Dr. Ross Mead]. In Spring 2013, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from [Visvesvaraya Technological University], India.
